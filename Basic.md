# stack memory vs heap memory

Basic data type:

stack and heap memory allocation available in python.

Id function:

```
name="Rala"
print(id(name))
2093070374064
help(id)
Help on built-in function id in module builtins:

id(obj, /)
    Return the identity of an object.
    
    This is guaranteed to be unique among simultaneously existing objects.
    (CPython uses the object's memory address.)
```

# comments in Python

# - single line comment

/*
multiline comment

*/

# Data Type


#Integer
#Floats
#Booleans
#Strings
#None


# type conversion functions.

```
string can not be convert to int and float.
```


# print function

1. Print multiple value using `,` inside pront function.
2. By default there is space in between output of print value.
3. Sep and End in print. By default sep and newline in print function.
4. print ?
```
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> print("Rajendra","Nivrutti","Ladkat")
Rajendra Nivrutti Ladkat
>>> print("Rajendra","Nivrutti","Ladkat",sep=":")
Rajendra:Nivrutti:Ladkat
>>>
```

```
Hello welcome to the coding
>>> print("Hello",' welcome', "to",' the coding',sep="\n")
Hello
 welcome

# operator in python

# 1. Arithmetic operations

1. Addition
2. Substraction
3. Division (/) -quotient - return float value.
4. Multiplication
5. mod(%) -> Reminder -> 5 % 2 = 1
6. Floor divison(//)
7. To the Power(**)

# Think on how we can use this operator on the different data type. Check for the different positive and negative value ranges.

For example:

5 + 5 is different than "Rala" + "Awesome"

5 ** 5 is different than 5**rala, rala ** rala.

# 2. Comparison Operator

==

!=
<
>
<=
>=

return is True and False

# 3. Assignment Operator

=
-=
+=
/=
*=

# 4. Logical operator

```
and
or 
not

return is boolean value i.e. True and False.
```
